# Reception QR Code System - Implementation Complete! ✅

## 🎯 Overview

The system now uses a **single, general QR code** placed at the reception desk that all returning visitors can scan for instant check-in.

## 🔄 User Flow

### First-Time Visitor
1. Opens app → Logs in
2. Enters their **name + phone + patient name**
3. Data is saved to Firebase database
4. Check-in successful → Entry logged
5. Checkout when leaving

### Returning Visitor (The Magic! ✨)
1. Opens app → Already logged in
2. Taps "**Scan QR**" from profile menu
3. Scans the **reception desk QR code**
4. System automatically:
   - Recognizes the user (from their login)
   - Fetches their last patient name from database
   - Creates a new check-in entry
   - Shows success screen
5. Checkout when leaving

## 📱 How It Works

### The Reception QR Code Contains:
```json
{
  "type": "RECEPTION_CHECKIN",
  "facility": "Hospital Reception",
  "timestamp": 1234567890
}
```

This is a **general identifier**, not personal data. Everyone scans the same QR code.

### When Scanned:
1. App recognizes it's a reception check-in QR
2. Gets current logged-in user's ID
3. Queries Firebase for their most recent visit
4. Extracts `patientName` and `visitorMobile` from last visit
5. Creates new visit entry with saved information
6. Done! ✅
